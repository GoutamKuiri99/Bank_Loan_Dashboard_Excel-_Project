# Project Description :-
 The project aims to improve and optimize the bank loan application process to provide customers with a seamless and efficient experience. With the increasing demand for financial assistance, it is imperative for banks to enhance their loan application procedures to meet customer expectations while ensuring rigorous risk assessment and compliance.
In this project I have created a Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard, a powerful tool designed to analyse and visualize Finance data for the years 2008 to 2016.

# Problem Statement :-
  The client wants to create a Bank Loan Dashboard for years 2008 to 2016 so that they can have insight on the below requirements:-

1. Year wise loan amount Stats

2. Grade and sub grade wise revol_bal

3. Total Payment for Verified Status Vs Total Payment for Non Verified Status

4. State wise and last_credit_pull_d wise loan status

5. Home ownership Vs last payment date stats

# Data Cleaning :-
I took the unstructured data , delimited it and apply some date function to extract year  of the data and arranged it in much more clean and organized way so that it'll
 be much more easy to analyze .

1. The data was given by Excel Institute in two .xlsx files.

2. This two .xlsx file merge in one file whith the help of Power Query.
  
3. Remove any columns that aren't being used.
 
4. Create one  columns to display the Year .
 
5. Make calculations and create slicer, Timeline and some KPI'S according to project details.
 
6. Create an interactive Microsoft Excel report .

# Data Analyze :-
1. I made few pivot tables tables based on information that I need. Then I analyzed the data to finally conclude that More people fully paid loan amount in 2011 year compare to other years.

2. By observing the chart we can see how Loan Amount is increasing by year.
   Starts from 2007 the loan amount is 22,19,275 and in the 2011 the loan amount is 26,05,06,575.
   We can subtract the new value to the old value to see the difference 26,05,06,575 - 22,19,275 = 258287300
   This amount is 258287300 increased in the duration of 4 years
   And Grand Total of all years is  44,56,02,650.00

# Data Visualizations:-
Using the pivot tables , I made pivot charts so that the data is in much more presentable way and also used slicers to quickly filter through data and then finally joined all the charts to create an interactive dashboard.

The dashboard involves few charts like Year wise loan amount Stats, and in Grade and sub grade wise revol_bal, Total Payment for Verified Status Vs Total Payment for Non Verified Status ,State wise and last_credit_pull_d wise loan status,and Home ownership Vs last payment date stats. The dashboard is designed to help Clients make more informed lending decisions. 

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
